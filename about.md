**makerfeed.org** is an open source project that attempts to aggregate what's going on in the maker community.

There are so many great communities in the maker world, and so many people doing great things.  The goal of makerfeed is to put all of this in one place and allow the git using community to keep it from going stale.

Every hour the site processes the list of feeds at https://github.com/andrewhodel/makerfeed/blob/master/index.feed and updates itself.

-----------

In the spirit of open source, makerfeed was built with a Git backend and is hosted on Github.  **Anyone with a github account can fully edit the content of the site with a pull request** - https://github.com/andrewhodel/makerfeed

Any other .md files in the repository are parsed and delivered as .html

https://github.com/andrewhodel/git-wiki allows this site to work in this way.
