**makerfeed.org** is an open source project that attempts to aggregate what's going on in the maker community.

In the spirit of open source, makerfeed was built with a Git backend and is hosted on Github.  **Anyone with a github account can fully edit the content of the site with a pull request** - https://github.com/andrewhodel/makerfeed

Every hour the site processes the list of feeds within the https://github.com/andrewhodel/makerfeed/blob/master/index.feed file to retrieve updated feeds.  Again, anyone with a Github account can make a pull request to modify the feed list as well.

Any other .md files in the repository are parsed and delivered as .html

https://github.com/andrewhodel/git-wiki allows this site to work in this way.
